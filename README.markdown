#Handcrafted Static HTML

##Description

Handcrafted Static HTML is a HTML base for creating simple static web projects or static click models. Rather than recreate the wheel each time, you can use this as a strong starting point with smart common defaults in place so you can get started right away.

Feel free to contribute. If you have questions, email [hello@gethandcrafted.com](mailto:hello@gethandcrafted.com).

##JavaScript

Handcrafted Static HTML supports jQuery out of the box. However, it's possible you might need to update to the latest version before getting started.

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library")
